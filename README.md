# About the Project

An Android application designed to help teenagers track their work shifts and income. Featuring job and shift management through CRUD operations, reminder notifications for upcoming shifts, real-time shift tracking, data visualization, and exporting data to Excel.
This was my final project for my 10-units of Computer Science in High School.
